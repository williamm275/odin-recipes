    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Firecracker chicken is very similar to sweet and sour chicken, only much
      spicier (hence the name). Browning the chicken keeps it moist and tender
      and if you serve it over rice, the heat is mellowed out.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><sup>2/3</sup> cup cornstarch</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
      <li><sup>1/2</sup> teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1<sup>1/2</sup> teaspoon kosher salt, divided</li>
      <li>3 large eggs, beaten</li>
      <li>
        1<sup>1/2</sup> pouns boneless skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1 inch
        pieces
      </li>
      <li><sup>1/4</sup> cup canola or peanut oil</li>
      <li><sup>3/4</sup> cup honey</li>
      <li><sup>1/2</sup> cup hot pepper sauce (such as Crystal)</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon rice vinegar</li>
      <li><sup>1/2</sup> teaspoon crushed red pepper (Optional)</li>
      <li>4 cups cooked white rice</li>
      <li><sup>1/2</sup> cup thinly sliced scallions</li>
      <li>toasted white sesame seeds, for garnish</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place a rack in the
        center of the oven.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine cornstarch, ginger, pepper, and 1 teaspoon salt in a large
        resealable bag or large bowl. Place beaten eggs in a large shallow bowl
        or dish. Add chicken to bag and shake to coat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high
        until shimmering.
      </li>
      <li>
        While oil is heating, transfer 1/3 of the chicken to dish with eggs and
        toss to coat. Using a slotted spoon, scoop out chicken, allowing excess
        egg to drip back into the bowl. Place in the hot skillet in an even
        layer. Cook, turning once, until chicken is golden on both sides, about
        2 minutes per side (chicken will not be cooked through at this point).
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer to a 9x13-inch baking dish. Repeat with remaining chicken,
        adding 1 tablespoon of oil to the skillet per new batch (3 batches
        total).
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir together honey, hot sauce, vinegar, crushed red pepper, and
        remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt in a bowl. Pour over chicken in the baking
        dish and stir to coat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center
        and the juices run clear, stirring halfway through, 25 to 30 minutes. An
        instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the chicken should
        read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>Serve over rice and sprinkle with scallions and sesame seeds.</li>
